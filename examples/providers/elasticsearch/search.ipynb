    "1. Install Python 3.10 if not already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the `retrieval-app` repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:openai/retrieval-app.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigate to the app directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /path/to/retrieval-app\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install `poetry`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install poetry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a new virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry env use python3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Install the `retrieval-app` dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Set app environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BEARER_TOKEN`: Secret token used by the app to authorize incoming requests. We will later include this in the request `headers`. The token can be generated however you prefer, such as using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The OpenAI API key used for generating embeddings with the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. [Get an API key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)!\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Set Elasticsearch-specific environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DATASTORE`: set to `elasticsearch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Set the Elasticsearch connection specific environment variables. Either set `ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID` or `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`.\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID`: Set to your deployment cloud id. You can find this in the [Elasticsearch console](https://cloud.elastic.co).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`: Set to your Elasticsearch URL, looks like `https://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>`. You can find this in the [Elasticsearch console](https://cloud.elastic.co).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Set the Elasticsearch authentication specific environment variables. Either set `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` and `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD` or `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME`: Set to your Elasticsearch username. You can find this in the [Elasticsearch console](https://cloud.elastic.co). Typically this is set to `elastic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`: Set to your Elasticsearch password. You can find this in the [Elasticsearch console](https://cloud.elastic.co) in security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`: Set to your Elasticsearch API key. You can set one up in Kibana Stack management page.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Set the Elasticsearch index specific environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX`: Set to the name of the Elasticsearch index you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Run the app with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry run start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If running the app locally you should see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000\n",
    "INFO:     Application startup complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the app is automatically connected to our index (specified by `ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX`), if no index with that name existed beforehand, the app creates one for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to move on to populating our index with some data."

      "0.92: At age eight, Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\n",
