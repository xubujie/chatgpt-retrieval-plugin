    "1. Install Python 3.10 if not already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the `retrieval-app` repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:openai/retrieval-app.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigate to the app directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /path/to/retrieval-app\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install `poetry`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install poetry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a new virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry env use python3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Install the `retrieval-app` dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Set app environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BEARER_TOKEN`: Secret token used by the app to authorize incoming requests. We will later include this in the request `headers`. The token can be generated however you prefer, such as using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The OpenAI API key used for generating embeddings with the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. [Get an API key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)!\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Set Elasticsearch-specific environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DATASTORE`: set to `elasticsearch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Set the Elasticsearch connection specific environment variables. Either set `ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID` or `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`.\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID`: Set to your deployment cloud id. You can find this in the [Elasticsearch console](https://cloud.elastic.co).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`: Set to your Elasticsearch URL, looks like `https://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>`. You can find this in the [Elasticsearch console](https://cloud.elastic.co).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Set the Elasticsearch authentication specific environment variables. Either set `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` and `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD` or `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME`: Set to your Elasticsearch username. You can find this in the [Elasticsearch console](https://cloud.elastic.co). Typically this is set to `elastic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`: Set to your Elasticsearch password. You can find this in the [Elasticsearch console](https://cloud.elastic.co) in security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`: Set to your Elasticsearch API key. You can set one up in Kibana Stack management page.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Set the Elasticsearch index specific environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX`: Set to the name of the Elasticsearch index you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Run the app with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry run start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If running the app locally you should see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000\n",
    "INFO:     Application startup complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the app is automatically connected to our index (specified by `ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX`), if no index with that name existed beforehand, the app creates one for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to move on to populating our index with some data."

      "0.93: On December 13, 2013, Beyoncé unexpectedly released her eponymous fifth studio album on the iTunes Store without any prior announcement or promotion. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album's unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\". The single \"Drunk in Love\", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation in the weeks before, Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour. It served as the couple's first co-headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Knowles also took home three competitive awards: Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for \"Pretty Hurts\", as well as best collaboration for \"Drunk in Love\". In November, Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $115 million in the year, more than double her earnings in 2013. Beyoncé was reissued with new material in three forms: as an extended play, a box set, as well as a full platinum edition.\n",
      "0.93: In September 2010, Beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show. She was named \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012. In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list. VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list. Several wax figures of Beyoncé are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world, including New York, Washington, D.C., Amsterdam, Bangkok, Hollywood and Sydney.\n",
      "0.92: Beyoncé is believed to have first started a relationship with Jay Z after a collaboration on \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). Beyoncé appeared as Jay Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, which would further fuel speculation of their relationship. On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay Z were married without publicity. As of April 2014, the couple have sold a combined 300 million records together. The couple are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years. Beyoncé suffered a miscarriage in 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured. She returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay Z traveled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for her 4, and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.\n",

While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.\n",
      "0.9: The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls and by singer Josephine Baker. Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing \"Déjà Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas. Beyoncé's third solo album I Am... Sasha Fierce was inspired by Jay Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles. Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie with additional influences by The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.\n",
      "0.9: She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts. Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay Z she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\". Beyoncé has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.\n",

Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing \"Déjà Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas. Beyoncé's third solo album I Am... Sasha Fierce was inspired by Jay Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles. Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie with additional influences by The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.\n",
      "8.21: Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence. Aged five, Beyoncé attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realised her purpose. When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\" She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\" and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\" She credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child. Her other musical influences include Aaliyah, Prince, Lauryn Hill, Sade Adu, Donna Summer, Mary J. Blige, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell.\n",
      "8.11: At age eight, Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\n",

      "In her music, what are some recurring elements in them?\n",
      "\n",
      "7.36: Beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by US First Lady Michelle Obama, saying \"She proves you can do it all\" and she has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman\". She has also discussed how Jay Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life. Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music... he is lyrical and raw\". In February 2013, Beyoncé said that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career. She commented: \"I think about Madonna and how she took all of the great things she achieved and started the label and developed other artists. But there are not enough of those women.\".\n",
      "4.92: Beyoncé's lighter skin color and costuming has drawn criticism from some in the African-American community. Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007, that he thinks race plays a role in many of these criticisms, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments. In 2008, L'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\", and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".\n",
